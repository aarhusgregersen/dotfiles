# dotfiles
This is my collection of dotfiles, inspired by [atomantic](https://github.com/atomantic/dotfiles) and [webpro](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles)

## Overview

This dotfiles is focused heavily around automation, being heavily inspired by atomantic's dotfiles (link above). Just running `install.sh` (instructions in the following section) will take care of the following:

- Install XCode Command Line Tools
- Install Brew
- Install git
- Install and update zsh
- Install Ruby
- Set ZSH as default shell
- Copies this entire repo via SSH
- Copies dotfiles (from `./homedir`) to `$HOME`
- Installs VIM
- Installs fonts
  ```
  ./fonts/install.sh
  brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
  require_brew svn #required for roboto
  require_cask font-fontawesome
  require_cask font-awesome-terminal-fonts
  require_cask font-hack
  require_cask font-inconsolata-dz-for-powerline
  require_cask font-inconsolata-g-for-powerline
  require_cask font-inconsolata-for-powerline
  require_cask font-roboto-mono
  require_cask font-roboto-mono-for-powerline
  require_cask font-source-code-pro
  ```
- Installs NVM at set default to latest stable version
- Sets global npm configuration `npm config set save-exact true`
- Sets sensible system defaults according to my preference :-)

Basically everything that you'd need!

## Setting up your Mac
You should complete the following steps in order, to use these dotfiles:
- Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store
- ?
- Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles
- run `install.sh` to start installation
- Restart your computer to finalize the process


## Todo:

- [x] Move MacOS defaults from install.sh to `macOs/defaults.sh`
- [x] Compare `defaults.sh` with individual sectionalized files in /macOs folder
- [ ] Find out how to test dotfiles (docker?)
  - Run interactive docker container: docker run -it ubuntu
  - Open new VM locally (virtualbox, etc)
  - Open a new cloud VM
  - Create a new user locally
  - Convince someone else to use your dotfiles
  - Buy a new computer

  ```
  sub_macos () {
    for DEFAULTS_FILE in "${DOTFILES_DIR}"/macos/defaults*.sh; do
      echo "Applying ${DEFAULTS_FILE}" && . "${DEFAULTS_FILE}"
    done
    echo "Done. Some changes may require a logout/restart to take effect."
  }

  sub_dock () {
    . "${DOTFILES_DIR}/macos/dock.sh" && echo "Dock reloaded."
  }
